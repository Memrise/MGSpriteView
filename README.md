MGSpriteView
============

A UIView subclass to play animation using a sprite sheet and compatible with the Cocos2d .plist syntax.

MGSpriteView wouldn't be possible without [MCSpriteLayer](http://mysterycoconut.com/blog/2011/01/cag1/) and the research and development work that produced it. See [Mystery Coconut Games blog](http://mysterycoconut.com/blog/) for more info.
